            <h2>THE SMALL UNIT TACTICS COURSES HAVE CHANGED</h2>
            <p>
              The Small Unit Tactics (SUT) courses have changed from a two
              previous basic and advanced course to a total of four courses. The
              first Small Unit Tactics Basic remains almost unchanged and
              focuses more in-depth on the absolute basics. Following this are
              the new courses Small Unit Tactics Ambush, this one focuses on
              executing a pre-planned ambush, Small Unit Tactics Raid, here you
              will learn how to execute a pre-planned raid and the fourth course
              is Small Unit Tactics Scenarios, where you can put all the
              experience you have earned so far to the test in non-stop 24 hours
              in prepared scenarios. The dates of all these mentioned courses
              have just been listed in our calendar.

            <h2>NEW HARD TASK COURSES</h2>
            <p>
              We have added several new shooting and tactical courses to our
              portfolio and we have slightly modified one for you. The first new
              course is a shooting course Tactical Shotgun 2, where you'll learn
              shoulder transition, shooting from behind cover, transition to a
              backup weapon, shooting after a long move with an emphasis on
              reloading while moving quickly, shooting from cover after a long
              move, and shooting at a moving target. We have also prepared Low
              Light Scenarios, this time it is a purely tactical course, and is
              designed for graduates of our two-day Low Light course. The one
              day session will review all the important techniques and tactics
              followed by force on force scenarios with FX Simunition weapons
              and ammunition. Many of you have attended the CQB Tactical Course
              and have either continued on to the two-day CQB Advanced Course or
              have just inquired about other options. As such, we've kept the
              CQB content, and completely remake CQB Advanced, where you'll
              enjoy breaching techniques of the doors and doing more shield and
              ladder work instead of vehicle and bus assault. We have
              subsequently expanded the repertoire of CQB courses to include
              one-day CQB Scenarios, where the name itself suggests that these
              will be non-stop, full-day force on force scenarios and CQB
              Vehicle Intervention which is a course that focuses only on
              intervention against an suspects or terrorists in a vehicle or
              bus. If anyone wants to take it all in one piece, we've thought of
              you too and put together the equivalent of American SWAT Week,
              which consists of all of the above mentioned courses and
              culminates with tactical movements and scenarios with live weapons
              and ammunition in a kill house. We called the course CQB Week. And
              we're not done yet and we're still working on a few more new
              courses that we'll introduce you to soon.
